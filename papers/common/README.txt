At Oxford I used to symlink to these files from each paper that I wrote. I have noow decided that it would be better to simply copy these files into each paper each time I make a new paper, which should guarantee that each paper builds correctly whenever I check it out in the future. These files are here in SVN just in case they are needed, but otherwise they should be considered old versions.
