This video shows indoor Manhattan models generated for a corridor
video sequence. We compare our approach to that of Flint et
al. [1]. The sequence contains clutter and motion blur, and is poorly
lit. The video shows our system generating higher quality videos in
comparison to [1].

Note that the models produced by [1] are very similar to that of Lee
et al.[2] since they use the same cues and optimize with respect to
the same cost function. The methods employed by [1] and [2] differ
primarily in the optimization strategy used (dynamic programming
versus branch-and-bound). Hence in terms of model quality this video
can also be treated also as a rough comparison with [2].
